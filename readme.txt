My mod changes all weapons so they have 2 buffs and 1 debuff. The buffs and debuffs are randomly assigned from a list of 10 buffs and 5
debuffs when the weapon spawns. You'll be limited to one weapon at a time, so you'll have to drop your weapon to switch. As you kill
enemies, you gain experience. Once you gain enough experience, your weapon will level up, which increases the strength of your buffs 
while lowering the strength of your debuffs. If you drop a weapon, all experience gained with it will be gone, even if you pick it 
back up immediately. You can check what buffs and debuffs you have with F. It'll also show you how much experience you have.

Buffs
Inc. Armor, Dec. Received Damage, Inc. Damage, Inc. Rate of Fire, Inc. Reload Speed, Healing Bullets,
Inc. Ammo Pickup, Inc. Max Ammo, Dec. Ammo Consumption, Inc. Range

Debuffs:
