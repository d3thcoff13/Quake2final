My mod changes all weapons so they have 2 buffs and 1 debuff. The buffs and debuffs are randomly assigned from a list of 10 buffs and 5 debuffs when the weapon spawns. You'll be limited to one weapon at a time, so you'll have to drop your weapon to switch. As you kill enemies, you gain experience. Once you gain enough experience, your weapon will level up, which increases the strength of your buffs while lowering the strength of your debuffs. If you drop a weapon, all experience gained with it will be gone, even if you pick it back up immediately. You can check what buffs and debuffs you have with F. It'll also show you how much experience you have.
